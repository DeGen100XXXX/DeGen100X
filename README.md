SPL-909 is not another meme template. It is an enforcement layer.
A protocol that takes every creator fee and every drop of liquidity out of human control, and places them inside an on-chain routing system that operates by rules — not promises.

In the current meme cycle, value doesn’t disappear because people stop believing; it disappears because fees, liquidity and incentives enter private wallets, off-chain decisions and untraceable shadows. Trust collapses not from volatility, but from the lack of verified flow.

SPL-909 was built to eliminate that failure mode entirely.

Every 909-token is born with a binding agreement: creator fees cannot be captured, diverted, or redirected by teams, insiders, private wallets or multisigs. The protocol receives them on-chain and distributes them automatically according to a predefined routing map. Nothing is left to negotiation. Nothing is left to reputation. Every allocation is visible, traceable and auditable in real time.

Liquidity follows the same logic. It is not owned — it is routed. Injected, recycled, reinforced and repurposed according to measurable on-chain conditions instead of sentiment or narrative swings. When a token accelerates, the system strengthens it. When it decays, the value does not vanish into zero; it flows back into the ecosystem and continues to compound.

A meme stops being a ticket. It becomes a verifiable circuit.

SPL-909 redefines what it means to launch on Solana: not a gamble where value leaks into darkness, but a lifecycle where every inflow remains accountable, where incentives align with the community, and where cryptography replaces trust.

What happens when you remove the human exit route and let the protocol decide where fees and liquidity go?

We’re about to find out.
